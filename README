NEU:
I've split the repos, so this is the front end only component - it's good to 
go, just needs a few more tests. I've been having a large amount of lack of 
time lately in which to develop stuff and creating FractalJS is a bit time
consuming so it seemed to make sense as I'd only really done the front end
bit anyway. So This will be ObjJS and FractalJS will depend on it and use
the same syntax but for the back end.

See https://github.com/scottbert/FractalJS if you have no idea what I'm 
talking about.

Scott, 22 Mar 2012.

UPDATED GOAL:
MVC Javascript on both server running Node and client. The same code is run in 
both, the framework works out what to do with it.
NOTE: Only the client is finished.

The framework is tiny. core is 5k minified, 2k gzipped. 
I need to document it somewhat.

ORIGINAL GOAL:
This is a project that has grown out of my day to day work to create a 
lightweight, jquery compatible MVC framework for creating a Javascript front
end application. 
It will be simple to use and encourage jQuery and Javascript best practice as 
well as CSS namespacing.
It will never be complete, there's always more and better ways of doing things 
than will be encapsulated here, so my aim is for a stable WIP.
I'm currently building the library, so don't try and use it until there are 
samples in the examples directory :)

CHANGELOG:
30-Aug-12
=========
Changed to ObjectJS. FractalJS will continue (albeit slowly) at the original repo 
location and will use ObjectJS as a dependency, so ObjectJS can happily live on
just the client for now as it is almost complete. 
TODO: Don't try using without jQuery/Zepto yet. Also wouldn't recommend yet using
it as I've not worked out where to put the docs.
Need to write unit tests for JSON templating.

18-Apr-12
=========
Added:
Native JSONP and a stub for native XHR
.bind for binding events (follows jQuery syntax, with the exception that it just 
takes two arguments: event and function)
tests for JSONP
code coverage plugin for tests.
10-Apr-12
=========
Added Events object for custom events. Added Events tests. Added linting
comments for JSLint and JSHint so it plays nicely with SublimeText.
Rewrote the internals of partial, renamed to curry, it now actually works
and passes tests.
05-Apr-12
=========
Added Function.prototype.partial, used John Resig's as a base and extended it to 
deal with multiple arguments.
http://ejohn.org/blog/partial-functions-in-javascript/
Added tests for BaseView and partial
Moved API methods createView/createController/createUI onto their base objects
Updated HelloWorld to work correctly

04-Apr-12
=========
Moved some API calls around for the final time.
Wrote tests for BaseController.
Tidied up loading of external files.
Modified build tools.
Created different testrunners, to test the minified output as well.

23-Mar-12
=========
Added build tools. build-all/core/jquery requires node.js and builds the output into 
the compiled directory.
Build core currently builds jquery core as the lib for now requires it. I shall 
write code shortly that removes this dependency.
Fixed tests.
Wrote more tests.

22-Mar-12
=========
I worked out a while back that there was already a JSMVC, so renamed the thing in 
my mind. Refactored for rename.

21-Mar-12:
=========
Finally got JsTestDriver running properly, added tests for a lot of things and 
refactored some other stuff.
Worked on the helloworld example.

8-Oct-11:
=========
Added jsmvc.js and moved core methods into it. Wrote includes method. Added 
jsmvc-test.html. No tests yet, coming soon.
Reformatted objects to better show API methods.
Added FF namespace.
Rewrote FF.Console.log
